# SciRust

SciRust is a scientific computing library written in Rust, aimed at providing tools for numerical computations, linear algebra, statistics, and more. The goal of the project is to create a high-performance, safe, and easy-to-use scientific library in Rust that can be applied in various domains like data science, machine learning, and engineering.


## üöß Under Development - Not Yet Usable

‚ö†Ô∏è **This project is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use.** Many features are still being implemented, and the API is subject to change. The current focus is on **linear algebra** implementation, which forms the foundation for other scientific and machine learning applications. While contributions are welcome, it is important to note that there may be breaking changes as the library evolves. Use at your own risk.

## Planned features

- **Linear Algebra**: Matrices, vectors, and various operations on them.
- **Statistics**: Basic statistical functions and probability distributions.
- **Numerical Methods**: Tools for numerical integration, differentiation, and optimization.
- **Random Number Generation**: Efficient generation of random numbers from various distributions.
- **Data Structures**: Custom data structures to support high-performance computations.
- **Machine Learning**: Tools and algorithms for machine learning, including linear regression, classification algorithms.

## Installation

Although the crate is published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/sci_rust), it is not ready for production use. However, if you'd like to experiment with the current state of the library, you can add it to your `Cargo.toml`:
